What happens when you navigate to google.com?


-Browser checks its own DNS cache for a corresponding IP address,
then your OS’ DNS cache, then (most likely) checks the default router's
DNS cache, then ISP / configured DNS server until it gets an answer.
-Browser builds HTTP GET string with “http://[url]” as the requested URL
-Browser sends request over the network (if asked how that works, mention
the Border Gateway Protocol and say you don’t know how it works)
-(Possible interaction with proxy server / load balancer / CDN / etc.)
-Server parses request string and routes it using Regex on the request path
-Application layer assembles a response, possibly via a connection to a DB server
-Response goes back over the network
-Browser parses the response
-Browser checks the headers, in particular the status code.
-Browser goes down each HTML element and either paints the DOM or executes the tag
-The browser builds a new GET request for each CSS or JS tag, goes through the
same steps as above, and runs the code before proceeding.
